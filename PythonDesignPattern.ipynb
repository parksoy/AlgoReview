    "Certainly! I'll provide an example of the Singleton design pattern, which ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to that instance.

    "\n",
    "In this example:\n",
    "\n",
    "- We create a `SingletonDatabase` class that uses the `__new__` method to ensure that only one instance is created. If an instance doesn't already exist, it creates one; otherwise, it returns the existing instance.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The `initialize_database` method initializes the database (simulated as a dictionary in this example).\n",
    "\n",
    "- The `insert_data` method allows inserting data into the database, and the `get_data` method allows retrieving data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- When we create multiple instances of `SingletonDatabase` (`db1` and `db2`), they both reference the same instance. Therefore, any data inserted into one instance is accessible from the other, demonstrating that there's only one instance of the database throughout the application.\n",

    "Certainly! The Factory design pattern is used to create objects without specifying the exact class of object that will be created. It defines an interface or abstract class for creating objects, and concrete subclasses (factories) implement this interface to produce objects of various types. Here's an example of the Factory pattern:\n",

    "- We have an abstract class `Animal` representing the products that can be created.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Concrete subclasses `Dog` and `Cat` implement the `Animal` interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "- We define an abstract factory, `AnimalFactory`, with a `create_animal` method that is used to create instances of concrete products.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Concrete factory classes, `DogFactory` and `CatFactory`, implement the `AnimalFactory` interface and provide specific implementations of `create_animal`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The `get_pet` function is a client code that uses the factory to create and return different types of pets without knowing their concrete classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "- By using the factory pattern, we can create objects (in this case, different types of animals) without explicitly specifying their classes in the client code. This makes it easy to extend and maintain the code when adding new types of animals or products."
