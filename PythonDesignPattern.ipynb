    "is a behavioral design pattern that allows you to pass requests along a chain of handlers. Each handler decides whether to process the request or pass it to the next handler in the chain. Here's an example of the Chain of Responsibility pattern in Python:\n",

    "- The requests are processed by the handlers based on their approval limits, and the appropriate handler approves or denies each request.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Chain of Responsibility pattern allows you to decouple the sender of a request from its receiver and lets you build a chain of handlers to process the request dynamically. This pattern is commonly used in scenarios where you have multiple objects that can handle a request, and you want to avoid coupling the sender to specific receivers."
