    "### Binary Tree :\n",
    "General purposed. \n",
    "In a binary tree, each node can have at most two children, referred to as the left child and the right child.\n",
    "There are no specific rules or constraints regarding the arrangement or order of values in a binary tree.\n",
    "Binary trees can be used for various purposes, including general hierarchical representations and binary expressions, where the structure is the primary concern.\n",
    "\n",
    "Usage:  \n",
    "* File Systems: Binary trees are commonly used to represent file systems, where each directory or file is a node, and the relationships between them are represented by the tree structure.  \n",
    "* Expression Trees: Binary trees can be used to represent arithmetic or logical expressions, where operators are internal nodes and operands are leaf nodes. This representation allows for evaluating and manipulating expressions.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Binary Search Tree (BST): log n\n",
    "Specialized. \n",
    "In a binary search tree, each node has a value, and the left child of a node contains a value less than or equal to its own value, while the right child contains a value greater than its own value.\n",
    "The values in a binary search tree are organized in a specific order, making it efficient for searching, insertion, and deletion operations.\n",
    "Binary search trees are primarily used for efficient searching and retrieval of data, as they enable faster lookup operations by exploiting the ordering property.\n",
    "\n",
    "Usage: \n",
    "* Efficient Searching: Binary search trees are ideal for searching operations. For example, in a phone book application, a binary search tree can be used to store names and corresponding phone numbers, allowing for fast lookups based on names.\n",
    "* Sorted Data Storage: Binary search trees can be used to store sorted data efficiently. In a task scheduling application, a binary search tree can store tasks based on their priority, allowing for quick retrieval of the highest-priority task.\n",
    "* Auto-Complete: Binary search trees can be used to implement auto-complete functionality in text editors or search engines. The tree stores a large set of words, and as the user types, the tree can be traversed to suggest possible completions based on the prefix entered.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Dictionary/Hashtable: \n",
    "\n",
    "* Binary Search Tree:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Pros: \n",
    "Supports efficient searching operations. The average time complexity for searching in a balanced binary search tree is O(log n), where n is the number of entries.\n",
    "Allows for sorted traversal, which can be useful for generating sorted lists of contacts or performing range queries.\n",
    "* Cons: \n",
    "The performance of a binary search tree heavily depends on its balance. If the tree becomes unbalanced, the time complexity for searching can degrade to O(n), where n is the number of entries.\n",
    "Insertion and deletion operations may require rebalancing the tree, which can be costly.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Dictionary/Hashtable:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Pros: \n",
    "Provides fast and constant-time lookup operations. The time complexity for dictionary/hashtable lookup is typically O(1), on average.\n",
    "Well-suited for scenarios where fast access based on keys is crucial.\n",
    "* Cons: \n",
    "Does not inherently support sorting or range queries. If you need to retrieve contacts in sorted order or perform range-based queries, additional operations or data structures may be required.\n",
    "Memory consumption can be higher than a binary search tree due to potential collisions and the need for additional memory for hash table slots.\n"
